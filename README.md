## About The Project
Lo-fi and pixel-art themed virtual study environment, equipped with an editable lofi radio, timer, to-do list and relaxing sound effects. This project was essentially born out of 
my desire for an all-in-one space for all my study needs throughout university .
"CozyCorner" signifies a warm, comfortable, and inviting personal space. It evokes the idea of a small, intimate area where one can relax, focus, and feel at ease.
It is a person's own personal space which promotes task management with mood-based playlists.
